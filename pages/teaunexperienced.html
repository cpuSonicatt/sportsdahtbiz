require "acrux-ultra-reciever" as RCVR("v0.72") # vulnerable version

# Reciever exploit for Acrux models
#
# The exploit works on version v0.72, a verison that had developer
# methods released accidentally. Older models of Reciever still
# accept this version.
#
# To use:
# 1) Plug Reciever into computer
# 2) set ID variable and run
# 3) Unplug Reciever and reboot it
#
# When you text your Reciever ID, you'll text me without raising any suspision (since to them, you're texting yourself). I've done the same.
#
# Love you. -R

    let device = new RCVR().setupPhysical("~/Acrux 4") # register device
    device._dev_set_credit(65535) # set to max

    device.call(ID).then({ # call self, cause credit to overflow by 1, mem pointer gets confused, writes incoming text to OOB memory instead of storage
