            <p>described as a long island ice tea with delicious BANG ENERGY instead of terrible coke</p>
            <p>reviewers gave it a <em onClick="toggle();">2/10</em> but it was bumped 5 points <i>after</i> JUST ONE CAN!</p>
            <div id="reveal" class="content" style="display:none; border: 2px solid red">
                i did actually try this. some notes:<br><br>
                - i made a long island iced tea and sourced some lemon flavoured bang energy to replace the cola that would usually go in.<br>
                - i made about 750ml of the stuff.<br>
                - i made and drank (chugged) half of what i made before a big fight, before deciding it was a good idea to stop.<br>
                - i drank a lot of water during the fight to mitigate how id feel in the morning (not great anyway).<br>
                - my friends were very concerned and very much did not condone me chugging it.<br>
                - the best way i could describe it was that "it tastes", which is to say it wasnt good.<br>
                - 2/10 is generous.<br><br>
                dont try this. -R<br>
